                      <p>My grandmother, Bessie Park, is a generous cook - I salivate thinking about the New Year’s feasts she has made our family. She is also a gentle hairstylist - I have many fond memories of her braiding my hair as I sat happily in her living room</p>
                      <p>She isn’t one to talk a lot about herself, but I’ve been learning more about her and her past through a book she wrote.  Her self-published memoir, <a href = "#">Mama’s Story</a>, chronicles the life of her mother, my great-grandmother, Myung Okie Kim</p>
                      <img src = "../public/images/sketch/gma.png" class = "float-image">
                      <p>Myung Okie Kim, at the age of 19, left her home and well off family in Korea to escape religious persecution. In June of 1917, she arrived at the port of Honolulu, Hawaii and became the wife of a man she didn’t know (more on that later!) It is because of her faith, adventurous spirit, and perseverance, that I even exist.
</p>
                      <p>And I think that she passed on a smidge of her boldness to me. Ninety eight years later, I’m about to embark on my own adventure. It is quite different from my great-grandmother’s but, I think it requires a similar type of courage: to leave home & family behind, to dive into the unknown, to create something new.

                      <p class = "post-quote">On a late autumn afternoon in southern province in Korea, a mother called her daughter to her side and said, “Myung Okie, your father is going to ask you if you would like to go to Hawaii, to America, to marry a Korean field worker and settle there [...] It is his desire that at least one of his offspring escape from the Japanese domination here in Korea and live as a Christian in a free country. He would send his son if he were old enough, but your brother is only five years old. You are the eldest, Myung Okie, and so he will ask you if you want to go. If you say, ‘Yes,’ he will select a suitable husband for you. However, he would never send you against your will. If you go to Hawaii, life will be very difficult for you and I do not know if we would ever see you again. I don’t want you to go, so when your father asks, I want you to answer ‘No.’ Do you understand? Say ‘No.’” The daughter nodded dutifully.</p>
                      <p class = "post-quote">That evening, her father indeed called her to his side and just as her mother had outlined, presented her with the option to go to Hawaii as a “picture bride.”</p>
                      <p class = "post-quote">“You will live a free life as a Christian,” he reiterated. “Will you go?” 
</p>
                      <p class = "post-quote">Without the slightest hesitation, she answered, “Yes.”
</p>
                      <p>My grandmother explained why Myung Okie (“Mama”) made this decision against her mother’s well. She writes that:</p>
                      <p class = "post-quote">When her father asked her if she would come to Hawaii, Mama had to say “Yes,” because she knew how much it meant to him and she hoped to fulfill his dream. She wanted so much to please her father. She also acknowledged that there was a promise of adventure she could hardly resist. And so she came to Hawaii.</p>
                      <p>This is filler for the two other sentences. My grandmother explained why Myung Okie (“Mama”) made this decision against her mother’s well. </p>
