                      <p>My grandmother&#44; Bessie Park&#44; is a generous cook - I salivate thinking about the New Year&rsquo;s feasts she has made our family. She is also a gentle hairstylist - I have many fond memories of her braiding my hair as I sat happily in her living room</p>
                      <p>She isn&rsquo;t one to talk a lot about herself&#44; but I&rsquo;ve been learning more about her and her past through a book she wrote.  Her self-published memoir&#44; <a href = "#">Mama&rsquo;s Story</a>&#44; chronicles the life of her mother&#44; my great-grandmother&#44; Myung Okie Kim</p>
                      <img src = "../public/images/sketch/gma.png" class = "float-image">
                      <p>Myung Okie Kim&#44; at the age of 19&#44; left her home and well off family in Korea to escape religious persecution. In June of 1917&#44; she arrived at the port of Honolulu&#44; Hawaii and became the wife of a man she didn&rsquo;t know (more on that later!) It is because of her faith&#44; adventurous spirit&#44; and perseverance&#44; that I even exist.
</p>
                      <p>And I think that she passed on a smidge of her boldness to me. Ninety eight years later&#44; I&rsquo;m about to embark on my own adventure. It is quite different from my great-grandmother&rsquo;s but&#44; I think it requires a similar type of courage: to leave home & family behind&#44; to dive into the unknown&#44; to create something new.

                      <p class = "post-quote">On a late autumn afternoon in southern province in Korea&#44; a mother called her daughter to her side and said&#44; &ldquo;Myung Okie&#44; your father is going to ask you if you would like to go to Hawaii&#44; to America&#44; to marry a Korean field worker and settle there &#91;...&#93; It is his desire that at least one of his offspring escape from the Japanese domination here in Korea and live as a Christian in a free country. He would send his son if he were old enough&#44; but your brother is only five years old. You are the eldest&#44; Myung Okie&#44; and so he will ask you if you want to go. If you say&#44; &lsquo;Yes&#44;&rsquo; he will select a suitable husband for you. However&#44; he would never send you against your will. If you go to Hawaii&#44; life will be very difficult for you and I do not know if we would ever see you again. I don&rsquo;t want you to go&#44; so when your father asks&#44; I want you to answer &lsquo;No.&rsquo; Do you understand? Say &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&rdquo; The daughter nodded dutifully.</p>
                      <p class = "post-quote">That evening&#44; her father indeed called her to his side and just as her mother had outlined&#44; presented her with the option to go to Hawaii as a &ldquo;picture bride.&rdquo;</p>
                      <p class = "post-quote">&ldquo;You will live a free life as a Christian&#44;&rdquo; he reiterated. &ldquo;Will you go?&rdquo; 
</p>
                      <p class = "post-quote">Without the slightest hesitation&#44; she answered&#44; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>
                      <p>My grandmother explained why Myung Okie (&ldquo;Mama&rdquo;) made this decision against her mother&rsquo;s well. She writes that:</p>
                      <p class = "post-quote">When her father asked her if she would come to Hawaii&#44; Mama had to say &ldquo;Yes&#44;&rdquo; because she knew how much it meant to him and she hoped to fulfill his dream. She wanted so much to please her father. She also acknowledged that there was a promise of adventure she could hardly resist. And so she came to Hawaii.</p>
                      <p>This is filler for the two other sentences. My grandmother explained why Myung Okie (&ldquo;Mama&rdquo;) made this decision against her mother&rsquo;s well. </p>
