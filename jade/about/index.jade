	p.statement
		| Themes of growth and change are the focus of my work: the entangling and liberating of groups of people, the shifting of the seasons, the mystery of myself maturing. What do the different phases look and feel like? What prompts or hinders these changes?
	p.statement
		| I explore these changes through interdisciplinary work, focusing on video/performance, photography, and found object collage construction. Each work reflects an inward journey. Using my own body in performance puts me in a vulnerable states where I am more able to achieve an emotional connection with my environment and with the viewer.
	p.statement
		| Understanding change is closely linked to correct perception, the ability to see the different pieces that make up one entity. Layers and multimedia work, then, are an important part of my work; as I explore change I build up, cover, peel back and expose different layers of paint, text, and pixels using organic lines and shapes that reflect the meandering lines of nature. I'm  drawn to layering and unveiling text amidst images. Words lead me to movements in my body, and the cycle of performance and creation continues.
	p.statement
		| My artistic process reflects the process of change and growth, from a disembodied concept to embodied action.  In looking deeply inward, I hope to describe a archetypal spiritual struggle.
